<h1>Spurge.js</h1>
<p>WIP, some tests that kinda worked last I checked:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="src/tests/arch.html">architecture exploration</a> - using the lib/Graph, lib/loop, lib/rendering to assemble a simple component heirarchy, attach a behavior to a component and have it update properties and render each tick. Its jumpy and has many issues.</li>
	<li><a href="src/tests/test_target.html">targetting exploration</a> - Click and it'll make its way over to that point. Also jumpy.</li>
	<li><a href="src/tests/effects.html">effects with CSS transitions</a> - a simple hit-state using a transition to center a glowyness on a sprite.</li>
</ul>
